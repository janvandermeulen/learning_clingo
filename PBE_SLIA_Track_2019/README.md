# PBE SLIA Track 2019

String-manipulation example from the SyGuS Challenge 2019 using programming by example. Inputs and output (see `data.jl`) are strings which need to be reached via a sequence of string-operations (see `grammars.jl`). 

Problems and their corresponding grammars share the same suffix.
